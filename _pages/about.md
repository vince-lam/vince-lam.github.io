I‚Äôm a data scientist with experience driving business impact by deploying end-to-end machine learning projects. I am passionate about data science, machine learning, and Generative AI. Currently freelancing in Singapore, I'm originally from London.

While working for the UK Government, I developed and deployed machine learning models, predicted Covid cases and deaths, applied probabilistic data linkage, automated pipelines, built public facing dashboards, orchestrated the department's central dashboard, and created a new data community for knowledge sharing.

This [blog](/posts/) is where I share my thoughts and experiences. Follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vince-lam) to stay up-to-date with my content.

You can see what I'm working on now [here](/now). If you'd like to get in touch about work opportunities, just drop me an [email](mailto:vincenthmlam@gmail.com).
