I’m a data scientist with a passion for AutoML, NLP, and data storytelling. Formerly based in London and newly relocated in Singapore. 

Within the UK public sector, I developed and deployed machine learning models, predicted Covid cases and deaths, applied probabilistic data linkage, automated pipelines, built public facing dashboards, and created a new knowledge share data community.
