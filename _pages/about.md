I’m a data scientist with experience in delivering business impact by deploying machine learning models, applying data analysis, communicating actionable insights to stakeholders, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I have a passion for AutoML, natural language processing, time-series analysis, modelling, and data storytelling. Formerly based in London and newly relocated in Singapore.

Within the UK public sector, I developed and deployed machine learning models, predicted Covid cases and deaths, applied probabilistic data linkage, automated pipelines, built public facing dashboards, orchestrated the central dashboard, and created a new knowledge share data community.
