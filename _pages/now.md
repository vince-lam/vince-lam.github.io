#### 🗓️ *Updated: 31st October 2023, Singapore*

Here's what I'm doing right **now**, inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about). The plan is to provide monthly updates. You can read previous entries and updates by clicking the toggle button at the bottom.

Currently writing this on Halloween so technically still on track for monthly updates!

### 🧠 Data Science

Still actively exploring permanent data science / AI opportunities in Singapore, a few interesting opportunities have potential - will see if they materialise to anything!

Had a coffee chat with the founder of a new AI consultancy, BrightRaven.ai, who welcomed me to the team as a freelance AI engineer consultant. They have some interesting LLM projects ongoing. Will see if I can juggle this on top of a full-time role.

Continue to write posts on AI and ML here on this blog, [Substack](https://vincelam.substack.com/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@vince-lam) pages. I need to work on spending less time researching and writing, currently it's taking me over a week to publish a post. Definitely guilty of Parkinson’s Law: *“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”*.

Showcase end-to-end machine learning projects on my GitHub to show data engineering and MLOps skills and tools to prospective employers, such as:

* working with APIs
* data processing (Spark)
* data orchestration (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect)
* stream processing (Kafka, Flink)
* cloud data storage/databases/data warehouses (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* experiment/model tracking and deployment (MLFlow, Kubeflow)
* CI/CD (Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
* making an impact through an API or dashboard visualisations (FastAPI, Flask, gradio, streamlit)
* good documentation/README
* Continue learning the latest AI advancements from meetups and conferences. I'll be attending [MLSG's meetup on LLMs and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/296955937) and also [SWITCH startups event](https://2023.switchsg.org/).

Technically not Data Science but will help with Data Science, blog writing, and life in general - is that I've finally settled on a **PKM (Personal Knowledge System)** that works for me, consisting of [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) (an open-source outliner alternative to Obsidian), Apple Notes, and Notion (for their databases feature for structured information). I recently came across the idea of a **"Second Brain"** by Tiago Forte and quite liked the idea of being able to easily access what you've read (books, academic papers, TowardsDataScience articles), thought, or even watched on YouTube - and seeing how all these ideas relate together through Logseq. Here's how my graph looks after a few months of writing:

### 🏃‍♂️ Health

Will be travelling next month but after that I'll be joining a climbing gym which also has great gym facilities too. Aim is to go at least 3x a week.

I've bailed on the last two running meetups due to the thunderstorms and lightning, fingers crossed it stays dry on the group running days!

### 📖 Reading

As well as finishing the two books from last month, I've finished reading Cal Newport's [Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work). Great book on producing deep and meaningful work and why it's becoming more valuable today. Will take some ideas, such as the physical timeblocking, but not other ideas (some where a bit too extreme for me).

Currently 44% of my through [The 4 Disciplines of of Execution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13260184-the-4-disciplines-of-execution) by Chris McChesney, Sean Covey, and Jim Huling. Does provide a simple but hard to implement framework to achieving your "Wildly Important Goals". Similar principals to OKRs from John Doerr's [Measure What Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39286958).

Started [The Satsuma Complex](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61401116) by Bob Mortimer as some non-heavy, light-hearted bedtime reading - need to balance all the productivity books I've been reading!

## Past *Now* entries

### 12 September 2023

#### 🧠 Data Science

Actively exploring data science opportunities in Singapore.  

Creating a new data community in Singapore with Son and Nirmalya, provisionally called **We Build Data**. We are hoping to launch in 6-8 weeks time.

>UPDATE ON 31/10/2023: This data community is on pause currently due to limited capacity but hopefully will be picked up in December

Adding useful content to this website, and cross-posting it to my [Substack](https://vincelam.substack.com/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@vince-lam) pages.

>UPDATE: Made my first contributions to both sites - Medium to reach a wider audience and Substack for more narrow and engaged audience

Working on end-to-end machine learning projects.

>UPDATE: Still ongoing

Attend more data science meetups that interest me and act upon my learnings. I'm excited to listen to my friend, Florian, speak on Explainable AI (XAI)  and learn about MakerSuit at at [Machine Learning Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/295882713/).

>UPDATE: Great presentation by Florian, will write about this and explainable AI in future

#### 👶 Exploration / Trying Something New

Enjoy my first F1 race and see Robbie Williams live!

>UPDATE: Amazing first F1 experience, lucky to have such a tense race for a street circuit!

My partner and I have decided to **Try Something New** each week, with a different theme each week (movement, culture, touristy, live events, crafts, and fun). These past two weeks we've tried Aerial Acrobatics (movement) and partied at the SG River street festival (fun). Next, we'll be seeing the scenic sights whilst hearing about Singapore's history on a River Boat Cruise (touristy).

Continue to make friends and genuine connections in Singapore - living life serendipitously.

#### 🏃‍♂️ Health

Climb 1-2x a week, I've currently climbed at 8 of Singapore's 41 climbing gyms. Still searching for the gym that I'll make my main base.

>UPDATE: Have now climbed at 10 climbing gyms, I think I've found the one to make a home base.

Join a running club around the Marina Bay Financial Centre. I've been burned too many times by the traffic lights!

>UPDATE: Have joined the MBS rowing club, super friendly folks who don't take themselves too seriously - hence why they're called the rowing club and not running club

Be more consistent on improving my mobility and flexibility. I'm enjoying stretching at a local studio but they only offer a few classes weekly. I'm going to try The Ready State app to supplement and help me make a routine of stretching.

>UPDATE: This didn't keep me accountable and have canceled my subscription

#### 📖 Reading

Algorithms to Live By - Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
>UPDATE: Finished reading this insightful book, it certainly does change your perspective and provides a logical reason for some of our intuitive decision making. Will write a book summary in future.

How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie

>UPDATE: Finished this timeless classic still holds up well today - my main takeaways are to be genuinely interested in people and to understand the other person's perspective
