*Updated: 12th September 2023, Singapore*

Here's what I'm doing right **now**, inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about). The plan is to provide monthly updates.

### üß† Data Science
* Actively exploring data science opportunities in Singapore.  
* Creating a new data community in Singapore with Son and Nirmalya, provisionally called **We Build Data**. We are hoping to launch in 6-8 weeks time.
* Adding useful content to this website, and cross-posting it to my [Substack](https://vincelam.substack.com/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@vince-lam) pages.
* Working on end-to-end machine learning projects.
* Attend more data science meetups that interest me and act upon my learnings.
    * I'm excited to listen to my friend, Florian, speak on Explainable AI (XAI)  and learn about MakerSuit at at [Machine Learning Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-singapore/events/295882713/).
    * Keen to see what the future of feature engineering looks like at [Data Science SG](https://www.meetup.com/datascience-sg-singapore/events/295898232/).

### üë∂ Exploration / Trying Something New
* Enjoy my first F1 race and see Robbie Williams live!
* My partner and I have decided to **Try Something New** each week, with a different theme each week (movement, culture, touristy, live events, crafts, and fun). These past two weeks we've tried Aerial Acrobatics (movement) and partied at the SG River street festival (fun). Next, we'll be seeing the scenic sights whilst hearing about Singapore's history on a River Boat Cruise (touristy).
* Continue to make friends and genuine connections in Singapore - living life serendipitously. 

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Health
* Climb 1-2x a week, I've currently climbed at 8 of Singapore's 41 climbing gyms. Still searching for the gym that I'll make my main base.
* Join a running club around the Marina Bay Financial Centre. I've been burned too many times by the traffic lights!
* Be more consistent on improving my mobility and flexibility. I'm enjoying stretching at a local studio but they only offer a few classes weekly. I'm going to try The Ready State app to supplement and help me make a routine of stretching.

* Algorithms to Live By - Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
