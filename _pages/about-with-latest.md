I’m a data scientist with experience in driving business impact through deploying end-to-end machine learning projects with MLOps, such as time-series analysis, anomaly detection, classification, and natural language processing. Collaborative team player adept at working across cross-functional teams and communicating with stakeholders to deliver actionable solutions. With a keen interest in Generative AI and LLMs. Formerly based in London and newly relocated in Singapore.

Within the UK public sector, I developed and deployed machine learning models, predicted Covid cases and deaths, applied probabilistic data linkage, automated pipelines, built public facing dashboards, orchestrated the organisation's central dashboard, and created a new knowledge share data community.

You can see what I'm working on now [here](now.md). If you'd like to get in touch, just drop me an [email](mailto:vincenthmlam@gmail.com).
