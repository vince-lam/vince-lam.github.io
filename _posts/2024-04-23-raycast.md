As knowledge workers, the tools we use and how we integrate them into our workflow can greatly impact our productivity, minimise context switching and distractions, and improve overall work experience. When I switched from a Windows machine to a MacBook M2 Pro in February 2023, I discovered Raycast, a free macOS launcher that has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. Raycast has transformed the way I interact with my MacBook, making it more enjoyable and efficient, and has quickly become my favorite Mac app.

In this blog post, I'll share my thoughts on why Raycast is a game-changer for productivity and highlight my most frequent use cases and demonstrate how learning shortcuts can significantly improve your workflow.

### What is Raycast?

Raycast is a free, fast, and powerful macOS launcher, think Spotlight (default launcher) or Alfred but better. With just two keystrokes, `Option` + `Space`, you can access Raycast and its productivity-boosting commands and extenstions.

### Why Raycast Stands Out?

Raycast is actively developed by a dedicated startup that engages with its community. The Raycast Youtube channel has great tips and inspiration for creative ways to use Raycast.

<br>
The best reason to use Raycast though is its thriving ecosystem of developers and the extensions that they build. This translates to a constantly evolving tool that adapts to your needs. I'll share the extensions I most commonly use below.

## Native Raycast Commands I to Streamline My Workflow

Many inbuilt Raycast commands replace third-party apps I previously installed.

| Command                                          | Description and examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Shortcut             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Clipboard history                                | Most useful feature for me. Stores history of your clipboard history for last 3 months (up to unlimited for the pro version). It shows a nice preview. You can search and filter your clipboard history too. And many more actions.                                                                                                                                           | `⌘` + `Shift` + `/`|
| Creating/searching Quicklinks                    | Create Quicklinks to launch anything faster: Links in the browser, project folders in the terminal or web searches. Examples: <br>• Google maps<br>•  Opening up gmail, google calendar, frequently accessed Google Docs and sheets<br>•  Opening directories in Finder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                      |
| Creating/searching Snippets                      | A snippet is a piece text and you can add placeholders for queries. Examples: <br>• Code snippets<br>• Email templates<br>• Common LLM prompts<br>                                                                                                |                      |
| Window management                                | I uninstalled rectangle, a popular free macOS window management tool. I use a mixture of direct keyboard shortcuts and simply typing the first character of each word.<br><br>• Left/right half<br>• Almost maximise<br>• First/last third/two-Thirds<br>• Make smaller/bigger incrementally (`Control` + `Option` + `- / +`)<br>• Top/bottom left/right quarters<br>• Top/bottom half<br> | `⌘` + `Space` + Initials |
| Emojis & symbols                                 | Great time saver if you prefer messaging on your MacBook than on your phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `Control` + `Shift` + `E`  |
| Opening apps                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                      |
| File Search                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `⌘` + `Space` + `FS`   |
| Calculator                                       | Can calculate maths, currency and time zone conversions, and probably a lot more.<br><br>In fact you can combine calculations of currency/time/maths, for example:<br>`1585 sgd to pounds / 2`<br>Returns: `£471`<br><br>Not even Google can calculate that.                                                                                                                                                        |                      |
| Timers, alarms, stopwatch                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                      |
| Floating Notes                                   | Useful for reminders, e.g. main task of the day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                      |

## Raycast Extensions

Those features alone are are enough to make me use Raycast. However, what truly sets Raycast apart is their Extension store, where anyone can develop an extension that can be approved.

<p style="text-align: center;font-size:13px">Raycast Extension Store</p>

Below are some of the extensions I use and how. Most extensions are activated simply opening Raycast and typing the first few characters or initials. I've starred ⭐ high usage shortcuts. Raycast learns your most frequently used commands and ranks them accordingly, ensuring that your favourite actions are always at your fingertips.

## Conclusion

Raycast has become an essential tool in my toolkit and I can't imagine using my MacBook without it. By leveraging its native commands and powerful extensions, I save countless hours every month. If you're looking to boost your productivity and enjoy a more streamlined workflow, give Raycast a try and download [here](https://www.raycast.com/) or via Homebrew `brew install --cask raycast`. 

Trust me, you won't look back. Hope you've found this useful!
