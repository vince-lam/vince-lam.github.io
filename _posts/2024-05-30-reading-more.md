Reading is a great habit that can expand your knowledge, spark creativity, and be inspired by others. I read an average of six books each year these past six years. This year, I've made a conscious effort to read more and learned some tips. I've currently read twelve books over the past six months.

### Tip 1: Build a reading streak

I have a daily reading streak where I need to read for at least five minutes a day. Those five minutes usually lead to longer reading sessions. This gamification helped me build a daily habit. Once you start a streak, you don't want to break it. I use Apple Books, which has an inbuilt tracker. You can use Kindle, a habit-tracking app, a spreadsheet, or a good old-fashioned journal.

### Tip 2: Read faster

I make the font larger on my iPad to make it easier to read and use my peripheral vision to scan down. The usual tip of not reading word by word applies. Instead, keep your eyes around a sentence's third to two-thirds point. You're less likely to lose your place in a book.

### Tip 3: Read several books simultaneously

Rather than forcing yourself to finish one book at a time and struggling because the content is too heavy, read several books at once. This can spice things up depending on your mood.

### Tip 4: Replace Doomscrolling with Reading

Since I use Apple Books, I can read across my devices in sync. Replacing mindless scrolling with reading has significantly increased my reading time.

### Tip 5: Listen to audiobooks

It all counts the same. Audiobooks are a great way to educate yourself while walking or running. They allow you to multitask and make the most of your time.

### Tip 6: Read at the end of the day

Reading is a great way to unwind at the end of the day. A Kindle is better to reduce blue light and help with sleep. I use blue light-blocking glasses to get around this.

Consistency is key when building any new habit. By incorporating these simple tips into your routine, I'm sure you'll be reading more and be better off for it.
