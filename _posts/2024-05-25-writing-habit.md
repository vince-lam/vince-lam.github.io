I recently signed up for [Dickie Bush](https://twitter.com/dickiebush) & [Nicolas Cole's](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77) cohort-based course, [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/).

### Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Writing is a useful and timeless skill in all areas of life:** It improves communication, structures thoughts, and serves as an outlet for self-expression, whether it's personal journaling, professional documentation, or persuasive storytelling. I'm excited to learn the frameworks from the best online writers for different platforms.

2. **Quantity Breeds Quality:** By writing daily and sharing online, I'll create more data points to learn from real-world feedback. This data-driven approach uses quantity as a forcing function for quality, learning what works and what doesn't.

3. **Expand My Luck Surface Area:** Writing online has already opened doors to freelance data science work for me. I can increase my chances of serendipitous encounters with a larger library of work. Create a 24/7 opportunity flywheel.

4. **Overcome Fears through Accountability:** I have countless ideas and insights to share, but I've struggled with the fear of judgement and perfectionism. Joining a supportive global community of like-minded writers will keep me accountable and inspired. Imperfect and published is better than “perfect” but unpublished—just ship.

Over the next 30 days, I plan on writing about Generative AI, freelance data science, and productivity.
