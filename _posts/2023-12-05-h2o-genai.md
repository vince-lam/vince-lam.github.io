I recently attended H2O.ai's Singapore GenAI Day, a fantastic event showcasing their latest contributions to GenAI. Highlights included:

1. **H2O and GenAI Keynote**: Insights and inspiration from Sri Satish Ambati, CEO and founder.

2. **Foundations of GenAI Ecosystems**: Shivam Bansal comprehensively covered everything from transformers to LLM guardrails.

3. **LLM + RAG Lab**: We all created our personal GenAI chatbot from our CVs using h2oGPTe with Llama2 and RAG, led by Chun Ming Lee.

4. **Building GenAI Apps**: Genevieve Richards led the workshop on developing a web app using Wave Studio which integrated the previous model.

5. **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Vishal Sharma, PHD's walked through LLM Studio for model fine-tuning and seamless integration with HuggingFace.

6. **Data Preparation and Evaluation**: Timothy CL Lam demonstrated LLM DataStudio and LLM Eval for efficient data preparation and model comparison.

The standout tools for me were LLM Studio for practical fine-tuning and LLM Eval for model assessment, both open-source. The upcoming RAG evaluation release is something Iâ€™m looking forward to, enhancing QA systems for real-world production. Excited to see how H2O's innovations continue to shape the GenAI ecosystem.
