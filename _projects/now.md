Here's what I'm doing right **now**, inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about) (see if you can find me on the main page).

## Life Update: From London to Singapore - A New Adventure Begins

I'm writing this quick life update from my sister's place in sunny London.

I'm thrilled to announce that I've landed a data scientist role at a world-leading Silicon Valley AI company in their Singapore office, starting this October! I'm excited to work on both predictive and generative data science use cases across various industries. Plus, I'll have the opportunity to travel around the Asia-Pacific region.

This company has been on my radar for several years and is a big name in the Machine Learning and Kaggle space. In fact, they hosted the very first meetup I attended when I first arrived in Singapore. I'll share my story on how I landed this role later. Moral of the story: persistence and networking pay off.

The past few weeks and months have been a rollercoaster. Just a few weeks ago, I thought I had left Singapore for good, saying goodbye to new friends and shipping all my belongings back to the UK. The day after I landed back in the UK, fresh from a week of rainforest trekking in Borneo, I received the job offer. Talk about Sod's law in action! The timing was less than ideal, but I'm psyched for this new opportunity.

Life certainly does throw curveballs. Sometimes you just have to laugh and roll with the punches.
